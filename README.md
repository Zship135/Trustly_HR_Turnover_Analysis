# Trustly Bank Human Resources Employee Turnover Analysis

## Problem Statement 

I was tasked by an HR Specialist from the Seattle HQ of Trustly Bank to investigate employee turnover rates in correlation with education and department. I was sent an Excel file to run my analysis. During a meeting, we discussed specific requirements for this project. We discussed in more detail that the company had noticed an uptick in employee turnover and would like to explore some possible directions to look into further. They suspect that employee education and job title may explain the increase, but they need more solid evidence. To discover these insights, I will work heavily in Excel to extract and calculate more relevant information. After this, I will make a Power BI dashboard to present to managers and stakeholders. Stakeholders also require a general HR overview, which will be incorporated into the same dashboard.

## Data Structure

The Excel I was sent has a few errors, making cleanup simple. The main work will be separating tables and writing formulas to calculate turnover concerning education and the department. Here is a rundown of the columns I have to start with.

We have employee_id, first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, age, hire_date, tenure_years, job_title, department, location_state, performance_rating, promotion_last_3yrs, attrition, employment_status, termination_date, salary, education_level.
